      <b>Eulalia</b>. God spede, &amp; a thousand mine old acqueint&#257;ce.
      xantippa.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. As many agayn, my dere hert. Eulalia. me semets ye ar war&#275;
      much faire now of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. Saye you so? gyue you me a mocke at the first dash.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. Nay veryly but I take you so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. Happely mi new gown maketh me to loke fayrer then I sholde
      doe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. Sothe you saye, I haue not sene a mynioner this many dayes, I
      reken it Englishe cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eu</b>. It is english stuff and dyed in Venis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. It is softer then sylke what an oriente purpel colore here is
      who gaue you so rich a gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eu</b>. How shoulde honeste women come by their gere? but by their
      husbandes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>x&#257;</b>. Happy arte thou that hathe suche an husband, but I wolde
      to god for his passyon, that I had maryed an husband of clowts, when I had
      maried col my good m&#257;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. Why say ye so. I pray you, are you at oddes now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>x&#257;</b>. I shal neuer be at one w<sup>t</sup> him ye se how
      beggerly I go. I haue not an hole smock to put on my backe, and he is wel
      contente with all: I praye god I neuer come in heuen &amp; I be not
      ashamed oftimes to shewe my head, when I se other wiues how net and trim
      they go that ar matched with farre porer m&#275; then he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. The apparell of honest wiues is not in the aray of the body,
      nor in the tirements of their head as saynte Peter the apostle teacheth vs
      (and that I learned a late at a sermon) but in good lyuynge and honest
      conuersacion and in the ornamentes of the soule, the c&#333;mon buenes ar
      painted up, to please manye mennes eies we ar trime ynough yf we please
      our husbands only.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. But yet my good man so euyll wylling to bestow ought vpon his
      wyfe, maketh good chere, and lassheth out the dowrye that hee hadde with
      mee no small pot of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulaly</b>, where vpon?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantipha</b>, wheron hym lykethe beste, at the tauerne, at the stewes
      and at the dyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalia</b> Peace saye not so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. wel yet thus it is, then when he c&#333;meth home to me at
      midnight, longe watched for, he lyeth rowtyng lyke a sloyne all the leue
      longe nyght, yea and now and th&#275; he all bespeweth his bed, and worse
      then I will say at this tyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulali</b>. Peace thou dyshonesteth thy self, when thou doest
      dishonesteth thy husb&#257;d.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. The deuyl take me bodye and bones but I had leuer lye by a
      sow with pigges, then with suche a bedfelowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulali</b>. Doest thou not then take him vp, wel favoredly for st&#363;bling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Xantip</b>. As he deserueth I spare no tonge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalia</b>. what doth he th&#275;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. At the first breake he toke me vp vengeably, trusting that
      he shoulde haue shak&#275; me of and put me to scilence with his crabid
      wordes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b> Came neuer your hote wordes vnto h&#257;dstrokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. On a tyme we fel so farre at wordes y<sup>t</sup> we wer
      almost by y<sup>e</sup> eares togither.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b> what say you wom&#257;?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. He toke vp a staffe wandryng at me, as the deuill had bene on
      hym ready to laye me on the bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. were thou not redye to ron in at the b&#275;ch hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xanti</b>. Nay mary I warrant the. I gat me a thre foted stole in hand,
      &amp; he had but ones layd his littell finger on me, he shulde not haue
      founde me lame. I woulde haue holden his nose to the grindst&#333;e
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalia</b>. A newe found shelde, ye wanted but youre dystaffe to haue
      made you a speare.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. And he shoulde not greatlye a laughed at his parte.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulali</b>. Ah my frynde. xantyppa. that way is neither good nor godly,
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantippa</b> what is neither good nor godly. yf he wyll not vse me, as
      hys wyfe: I wil not take him for my husbande.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalya</b>. But Paule sayeth that wyues shoulde bee boner and buxome
      vnto their husbandes with all humylytye, and Peter also bryngethe vs an
      example of Sara, that called her husbande Abrahame, Lorde.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantippa</b>. I know that as well as you th&#275; y<sup>e</sup> same
      paule say that men shoulde loue theyr wyues, as Christ loues his spouse
      the churche let him do his duete I wil do myne.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. But for all that, when the matter is so farre that the one
      muste forber the other it is reason that the woman giue place vnto the
      man,
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. Is he meete to be called my husb&#257;de that maketh me his
      vnderlynge and his dryuel?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. But tel me dame x&#257;tip. Would he neuer offre the stripes
      after that
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>x&#257;tip</b>. Not a stripe, and therin he was the wyser man for &amp;
      he had he should haue repented euery vayne in hys harte.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulali</b>. But thou offered him foule wordes plentie,
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. And will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. What doth he y<sup>e</sup> meane seas&#333;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. What doth he sometyme cowcheth an hogeshed, somtime he doth
      nothing but stande and laughe at me, other whyle takethe hys Lute wheron
      is scarslie three strynges layenge on that as fast as he may dryue because
      he would not here me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. Doeth that greue thee?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantippa</b>. To beyonde home, manie a tyme I haue much a do to hold my
      handes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. Neighbour. xantip. wylt thou gyue me leaue to be playn with
      the.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantippa</b> Good leaue haue you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. Be as bolde on me agayne our olde acquayntaunce and amite,
      euen fr&#333; our chyldhode, would it should be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantippa</b>. Trueth you saie, there was neuer woman kinde that I
      fauoured more
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Elaly</b> Whatsoeuer thy husb&#257;d be, marke well this, chaunge thou
      canst not, In the olde lawe, where the deuill hadde cast aboone betwene
      the man and the wife, at the worste waye they myght be deuorsed, but now
      that remedie is past, eu&#275; till death depart you he must nedes be thy
      husbande, and thou hys wyfe,
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. Il mote they thryue &amp; thei that taken away that liberty
      from vs
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalia</b>. Beware what thou sayest, it was christes act.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>X&#257;</b>. I can euil beleue that
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. It is none otherwyse, now it is beste that eyther of you one
      beyng with an other, ye laboure to liue at reste and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>typpa. Why? can I forgeue him a new,
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eu</b>. It lieth great parte in the wom&#275;, for the orderinge of
      theyr husbandes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. Leadest thou a mery life with thine.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b> Now all is well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. Ergo ther was somwhat to do at your fyrste metying
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. Neuer no greate busynes, but yet as it, happeneth now and
      than betwene man &amp; wom&#257;, there was foule cloudes a loft, that
      might haue made a storme but that they were ouer blowen with good
      humanitie and wyse handlynge. Euery man hath hys maner and euery m&#257;
      hath his seueral aptite or mynde, and thinkes hys owne way best, &amp; yf
      we list not to lie there liueth no m&#257; without faulte, which yf anie
      were elles, ywis in wedlocke they ought to know and not vtterly hated
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>, you say well,
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalya</b>. It happeneth many times that loue dayes breketh betwene
      man and wife, before y<sup>e</sup> one be perfitly know&#275; vnto the
      other beware of that in any wife, for when malice is ones begon, loue is
      but barely redressed agayne, namely, yf the mater grow furthe unto bytter
      checkes, &amp; shamfull raylinges such things as are fastened with glew,
      yf a manne wyll all to shake them strayght waye whyle the glew is warme,
      they soone fal in peces, but after y<sup>e</sup> glew is ones dried vp
      they cleue togither so fast as anie thing, wherefore at the beginning a
      meanes must be made, that loue mai encrease and be made sure betwene y<sup>e</sup>
      man &amp; the wife, &amp; that is best brought aboute by gentilnesse and
      fayre condycions, for the loue that beautie onelie causeth, is in a maner
      but a cheri faire
    </p>
    <p>
      Xan. But I praye you hartelye tell me, by what pollycy ye brought your
      good man to folow your daunce.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. I wyll tell you on this condicyon, that ye will folowe me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>, It is as easy as water if ye c&#257; find in your hart to do
      it, nor yet no good time past for he is a yong m&#257;, and you ar but
      agirle of age, and I trowe it is not a yere ful sins ye wer maried.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>X&#257;</b> All thys is true
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalia</b>. I wyll shew you then. But you must kepe it secret
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. with a ryght good wyl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. This was my chyefe care, to kepe me alwayes in my housbandes
      fauoure, that there shulde nothyng angre him I obserued his appetite and
      pleasure I marked the tymes bothe whan he woulde be pleased and when he
      wold be all byshrwed, as they tameth the Elephantes and Lyons or suche
      beastes that can not be wonne by str&#275;gth
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>typpa. Suche a beaste haue I at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. Thei that goth vnto the Elephantes weare no white garmentes,
      nor they that tame wylde bulles, weare no blasynge reedes, for experience
      teacheth, that suche beastes bee madde with those colours, like as the
      Tygers by the sound of tumbrels be made so wode, that thei plucke
      theymself in peces. Also thei y<sup>t</sup> breake horses haue their
      termes and theyr soundes theyr hadlynges, and other knackes to breake
      their wyldnes, wyth all. Howe much more then is it oure duetyes that y<sup>e</sup>
      wyues to use suche craftes toward our husbandes with wh&#333; all our lyfe
      tyme wil we, nyl we is one house, and one bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. furthwith your tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>, wh&#275; I had ones marked there thynges. I applied my selfe
      unto hym, well ware not to displease him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantip</b>. How could thou do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalya</b>. Fyrste in the ouerseynge my householde, which is the very
      charge and cure of wyues, I wayted euer, not onely gyuynge hede that
      nothing shoulde be forgotten or undoone, but that althynges should be as
      he woulde haue it, wer it euer so small a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>x&#257;</b>. wherin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalia</b>. As thus. Yf mi good man had a fantasye to this thynge, or
      to that thyng, or if he would haue his meate dressed on this fashion, or
      that fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xan</b>. But howe couldest thou fashyon thye selfe after hys wyll and
      mynde, that eyther woulde not be at home or elles be as freshe as a saulte
      heryng.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Elali</b>. Abyde a while. I come not at that yet, yf my husband wer
      very sad at anye tyme, no time to speake to him. I laughed not nor tryfled
      him as many a woman doth but I looked rufully and heauyly, for as a glasse
      (if it be a true stone) representeth euer y<sup>e</sup> physnamy of hym
      that loketh in it, so lykewyse it becommeth a wedded woman alway to agre
      vnto the appetite of her husbande, that she be not mery wh&#275; he
      murneth, nor dysposed to play wh&#275; he is sad. And if that at any time
      he be waiward shrewshaken, either I pacyfye hym with faire wordes, or I
      let hym alone, vntyll the wynd be ouerblowen gyuing him neuer a word at
      al, vntil the time come that I may eyther excuse my faute, or tell hym of
      hys. In lyke wyse when he commeth home wel whitled, I gyue hym gentyll and
      fayre woordes, so with fayre entreatynge I gette hym to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantyppa</b>, O careful state of wyues, wh&#275; they muste be gladde
      and fayne to followe their husbandes mindes, be thei eluyshe, dronken, or
      doying what myschiefe they liste.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. As whoe saieth this gentill dealynge serueth not for bothe
      partyes, for they spyte of theyr berdes muste suffre many thynges in our
      demeanor, yet a time ther is, wh&#275; in a weighty matter it is laufull
      that the wyfe tell the good m&#257; his faute, if that it be matter of
      substaunce, for at lyght trifles, it is best to play byll under wynge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>xantyp</b>. what tune is that
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. when he is ydle, neither angry, pensife, nor ouersen, then
      betwixt you two secretly he must be told his faute g&#275;tly, or rather
      intreated, that in this thynge or that he play the better husbande to loke
      better to his good name and fame and to his helth and this tellyng must be
      myxt with mery conceites and pleasaunt wordes many times I make a meane to
      tel my tale after this fashyon, that he shall promise me, he shal take no
      displeasure wyth my thynge, that I a foolyshe woman shall breake vnto hym,
      that pertayneth eyther to hys helthe worshyppe or welth. When I haue sayde
      that I woulde, I chop cleane from that communication and falle into some
      other pastime, for this is all our fautes, neyghbour Xantippa, that wh&#275;
      we begyn ones to chat our tounges neuer lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Xantip</b>. So men say
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eulalia</b>. Thus was I well ware on, that I neuer tell my husb&#257;d
      his fautes before companie, nor I neuer caried any c&#333;playnte furthe a
      dores: the mendes is soner made wh&#275; none knoweth it but two, and
      there were anie suche faute that myght not be wel borne nor am&#275;ded by
      y<sup>e</sup> wyues tellige, it is more laudable that the wife make
      complaynte vnto the Parentes and kynsfolke of her husband, then vnto her
      own, and so to moderate her complaynte that she seme not to hate hym but
      hys vice nor let her play all the blabbe, that in some poynt vnutered, he
      may know &amp; loue his wiues curteysy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Xantip</b>. She had nede be aswellerned wom&#257;, that would do all
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eu</b>. Mary through suche demeanoure, we shall sterre our husb&#257;des
      vnto lyke gentylnesse.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. I am aquented with a certayne gentelman well lerned and a
      veri honest man, he maried a yonge wyfe, a mayden of. xvii. yeare olde
      brede and brought vp of a chylde in the countre vnder her fathers and
      mother wing (as gentilmen delite to dwel in the countre) to hunt &amp;
      hawke This yong g&#275;tilman would haue one that were unbrok&#275;,
      because he might the soner breake her after hys owne mind, he beg&#257; to
      entre her in learning syngynge, and playinge, and by lytle and lytle to
      vse here to repete suche thynges as she harde at sermons, and to instruct
      her with other things that myght haue doone her more good in time to come.
      This gere, because it was stra&#363;ge vnto this young wom&#257; which at
      home was brought vp in all ydelnesse, and with the light communication of
      her fathers seruantes, and other pastimes, beg&#257; to waxe greuouse
      &amp; paynfull, vnto her. She withdrew her good mynde and dylygence and wh&#275;
      her husband called vpon her she put y<sup>e</sup> finger in the eye, and
      wepte and many times she would fal downe on the grounde, beatynge her head
      agaynst the floure, as one that woulde be out of thys worlde. When there
      was no healpe for this gere, the good man as though he hadde bene wel
      asked his wyfe yf she woulde ryde into the countre with him a sporting
      vnto her fathers house, so that she graunted anone. When they were c&#333;m&#275;
      thyther, the gentilman left his wyfe with her mother &amp; her sisters he
      w&#275;t furth an huntynge with his father in lawe, there betwene theym
      two, he shewed al together, how that he hadde hoped to haue had a louynge
      companion to lead his lyfe withall, now he hath one that is alwaies
      blubberynge and pyninge her selfe awaye withoute anye remedie, he prayeth
      him to lay to hys hande in amendinge his doughters fautes her father
      answered y<sup>t</sup> he had ones giuen hym his doughter, and yf that she
      woulde not be rewled by wordes (a goddes name take Stafforde lawe) she was
      his owne. Then the g&#275;tylman sayd agayne, I know that I may do but I
      had leuer haue her am&#275;ded eyther by youre good counsell or
      commaundement, then to come vnto that extreme waies, her father promised
      that he would fynde a remedye. After a dai or two, he espied time and
      place wh&#275; he might be alone with his doughter. Then he loked soureli
      vp&#333; his doughter, as though he had bene horne woode with her, he
      began to reherse how foule a beaste she was, how he feared many tymes that
      she neuer haue bestowed her. And yet sayde he much a doe, vnto my great
      coste and charg, I haue gott&#275; the one that moughte lye by any Ladyes
      syde, and she were a quene and yet thou not perceiuying what I haue done
      for the nor knowynge that thou hast suche a man whiche but of his goodnes
      myghte thynke thee to euill to be stoye in his kytchen, thou contrariest
      al his mind to make a short tale he spake so sharpely to her, that she
      feared that he wold haue beaten her. It is a man of asubtyll and wylye
      wytte, whyche wythout a vysarde is ready to playe anye maner of parte. Th&#275;
      this yonge wife what for feare, and for trouthe of the matter, cleane
      stryken oute of countenaunce, fell downe at her fathers fete desyryng hym
      that he wolde forgette and forgiue her all that was past and euer after
      she woulde doe her duetye Her father forgaue her, and promised that she
      shoulde finde him a kynd and a louynge father, yf so be that she
      perfourmed her promyse.

      do, vsed much huntyng in the cuntre, where he happened on a younge
      damoysell, a very pore wom&#257;s child on wh&#333; he doted a man well
      stryken in age, and for her sake he lay oft&#275; out of his owne house
      his excuse was h&#363;t&icirc;g. This m&#257;s wife an exceding honest wom&#257;,
      halfe deale suspecte the mater, tried out her husbandes falshed, on a tyme
      wh&#275; he had taken his iourney fourth of the town vnto some other
      waies, she wente vnto that poore cotage and boulted out all the hoole
      matter, where he laye on nights, wheron he dr&#257;ke, what thyng thei had
      to welc&#333; him withall. There was neither one thyng nor other, but bare
      walles. This good wom&#257; returned home, and sone after came againe
      brynginge w<sup>t</sup> her a good soft bed, and al therto belongyng and
      certain plate besydes that she gaue them moneye, chargynge them that if
      the Gentilm&#257; came agayne, they shold entreate him better not beyng
      know&#275; al this while that she was his wyfe, but fayued her to be her
      sister. Not long after her husband stale thether againe, he sawe the howse
      otherwyse decked, and better fare then he was wounte to haue. He asked,
      frome whence commeth al this goodly gere? They sayde that an honeste
      matrone, a kynsewoman of hys hadde broughte it thyther and commaunded
      thenm that he should be well cherished when so euer he came, by and by his
      hart gaue him that it was hys wiues dede, whan he came home he dema&#363;ded
      of her yf she hadde bene there or nay, she sayd yea. Then he asked her for
      what purpose she sente all that housholde stuffe thyther. Man (said she)
      ye haue b&#275; tenderly brought vp. I perceiued that ye were but corslie
      handled there, me thought that it was my part, seing it was your wyll and
      pleasure to be there ye shoulde be better loked to.
    </p>

      haue layd vnder him a bundel of nettels: or a burden of thistels.

      <b>Eula</b>. But here the end her husbande perceyuyng the honeste of her
      great pacience neuer after laye from her, but made good cheare at home
      with his owne. I am sure ye knowe Gilberte the hol&#257;der.

    <p>
      <b>Eula</b>. But how much wiselier dyd this woman? She desyred that yonge

      brought home also her husband without ani witchraft or sorserie, and yf
      that at anye season he supped abrode with her she would sende vnto them
      some good dayntie morsel, and byd him make good chere
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Xantippa</b>. I had leuer be slayne then I woulde be bawde vnto myne
      owne husbande.

      better, then she shoulde be her shrewyshnesse, haue putte her husbandes
      minde cleane of from her, and so haue ledde all her life in trouble and
      heuynesse.

      not abyde it.
    </p>
    <p>

      One of oure neyghboures, a well disposed and a goddes man, but that he is
      some what testie, on a day pomeld his wife well and thriftely aboute the
      pate and so good a woman as euer was borne, she picked her into an inner
      parler, and there weepynge and sobbynge, eased her heuye harte, anone
      after, by chaunce her husbande came into the same place, and founde hys
      wyfe wepyng. What sitest thou heare sayth he seighing &amp; sobb&icirc;g
      like a child Th&#275; she like a wise woman sayde. Is it not more honesty
      for me to lamente my dolours here in a secret place, th&#275; to make
      wondering and on oute crye in the strete, as other wom&#275; do. At so
      wyfely and womanly a saing his hart melted, promysynge her faythfullye and
      truelie that he woulde neuer laye stroke on her afterwarde, nor neuer did.
    </p>
    <p>

      There was a man that maried a woman whiche hadde great riches and beawtye.
      Howe bee it she hadde suche an impedyment of nature that she was domme and
      coulde not speake, whiche thynge made him ryghte pensyfe, and sayd,
      wherfore vpon a daye as he walked alone ryght heuye in hearte thynkynge
      vpon his wyfe. There came one to hym and asked him what was the cause of
      his heuynesse whiche answered that it was onely bycause his wife was borne
      d&#333;me. To whome this other said I shal shewe the soone a remedy and a
      medicyne (therfore that is thus) go tak an aspen leafe and lay it vnder
      her t&#333;ge this night shee beinge a sleape, and I warrant the that shee
      shall speake on the morowe whiche man beyng glad of thys medycyne prepared
      therfore and gathered aspen leaues, wherfore he layd thre of them vnder
      her tonge whan shee was a sleape. And on the morow when he him selfe
      awaked he Desyrous to know how hys medicine wrought being in bed with her,
      he demaunded of her how she did, and sod&#275;ly she answered and sayd, I
      beshrewe thy harte for waking me so early, and so by the vertue of that
      medycyne she was restored to her speche. But in c&#333;clusion her spech
      encresed day by day and she was so curst of c&#333;dycyon that euery daie
      she brauled and chyd with her husbande, so muche at the laste he was more
      weped, and had much more trouble and disease wyth her shrewed wordes then
      he hadde before wh&#275; she was dumme, wherfore as he walked another time
      alone he happened to mete agayne with the same personne that taught hym
      the sayde medycine and sayde to hym thys wyse. Syr ye taught me a medicin
      but late to make my domme wyfe to speake, byddynge me lay an aspen leafe
      vnder her to&#363;g when she sleapte, and I layde three Aspen leaves
      there. Wherfore nowe she speaketh. But yet she speaketh soo much &amp; so
      shrewdlye that I am more werier of her now, then I was when she was d&#333;me:
      Wherfore I praie you teache me a medycine to modyfye her that she speake
      not so muche. This other answered and sayd thus. Sir I am a deuyl of hel
      but I am one of th&#275; that haue least power there. Al be yet I haue
      power to make a wom&#257; to speake, but and yf a woman begin ones to
      speake, I nor al the deuyls in hel that haue the mooste power be not able
      to make a woman to be styll, nor to cause her to leue speakyng.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
