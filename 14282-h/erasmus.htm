as a glasse (if it be a true stone) representeth euer y<sup>e</sup>

<p>There was a man that maried a woman
whiche hadde great riches and beawtye. Howe bee it she hadde suche an
impedyment of nature that she was domme and coulde not speake, whiche
thynge made him ryghte pensyfe, and sayd, wherfore vpon a daye as he
walked alone ryght heuye in hearte thynkynge vpon his wyfe. There came
one to hym and asked him what was the cause of his heuynesse whiche
answered that it was onely bycause his wife was borne d&#333;me. To
whome this other said I shal shewe the soone a remedy and a medicyne
(therfore that is thus) go tak an aspen leafe and lay it vnder her
t&#333;ge this night shee beinge a sleape, and I warrant the that shee
shall speake on the morowe whiche man beyng glad of thys medycyne
prepared therfore and gathered aspen leaues, wherfore he layd thre of
them vnder her tonge whan shee was a sleape.

And on the morow when he
him selfe awaked he Desyrous to know how hys medicine wrought being in
bed with her, he demaunded of her how she did, and sod&#275;ly she
answered and sayd, I beshrewe thy harte for waking me so early, and so
by the vertue of that medycyne she was restored to her speche. But in
c&#333;clusion her spech encresed day by day and she was so curst of
c&#333;dycyon that euery daie she brauled and chyd with her husbande, so
muche at the laste he was more weped, and had much more trouble and
disease wyth her shrewed wordes then he hadde before wh&#275; she was
dumme, wherfore as he walked another time alone he happened to mete
agayne with the same personne that taught hym the sayde medycine and
sayde to hym thys wyse. Syr ye taught me a medicin but late to make my
domme wyfe to speake, byddynge me lay an aspen leafe vnder her to&#363;g
when she sleapte, and I layde three Aspen leaves there.

Wherfore nowe
she speaketh. But yet she speaketh soo much &amp; so shrewdlye that I am
more werier of her now, then I was when she was d&#333;me: Wherfore I
praie you teache me a medycine to modyfye her that she speake not so
muche. This other answered and sayd thus. Sir I am a deuyl of hel but I
am one of th&#275; that haue least power there. Al be yet I haue power
to make a wom&#257; to speake, but and yf a woman begin ones to speake,
I nor al the deuyls in hel that haue the mooste power be not able to
make a woman to be styll, nor to cause her to leue speakyng.
